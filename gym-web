                <p>
                    "Fitness" is a broad term that means something different to each person, but it refers to your own
                    optimal health and overall well-being. Being fit not only means physical health, but emotional and
                    mental health, too. It defines every aspect of your health. Smart eating and active living are
                    fundamental to fitness.

                    According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Complete Food and Nutrition Guide (3rd ed.),
                    when
                    you are fit, you have:
                    Energy to do what's important to you and to be more productive
                    Stamina and a positive outlook to handle the mental challenges and emotional ups and downs of
                    everyday
                    life and to deal with stress
                    Reduced risk for many health problems, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis
                    The chance to look and feel your best
                    Physical strength and endurance to accomplish physical challenges
                    A better chance for a higher quality of life and perhaps a longer life, too

                <h3 id="h2">Balance Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    To be able to function properly, our body needs all the nutrients that come from foods, that is
                    proteins, carbohydrates (sugar) and fats, plus vitamins and minerals. To help maintain a healthy
                    weight
                    and have the best chance to stay in good health, balance is key.

                <h3 id="h3">Physical Strength</h3>
                <p>
                    An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors; the cross-sectional area of muscle
                    fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment. Individuals with a high
                    proportion of type I slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual
                    with
                    a high proportion of type II fast twitch fibers, but would have a greater inherent capacity for
                    physical
                    endurance. The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical
                    strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone), though the unique
                    position
                    within this envelope is determined by training. Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined
                    through
                    a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular
                    activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are
                    able
                    to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon
                    genes
                    dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate
                    nutrients in the diet. A one-repetition maximum test is the most accurate way to determine maximum
                    muscular strength.
